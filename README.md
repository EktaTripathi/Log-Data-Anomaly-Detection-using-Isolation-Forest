# Log-Data-Anomaly-Detection-using-Isolation-Forest
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and anomaly detection on log data using the Isolation Forest algorithm. The log data, typically generated from microservices, is preprocessed, analyzed, and then used to detect anomalies, which could indicate potential issues or irregularities in the system.

# Key Features:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization to understand the underlying patterns in the log data.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Basic NLP techniques are applied to analyze the body of log messages, helping to extract insights from textual data.
3. Anomaly Detection: Implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in the log data based on attributes like timestamps, severity levels, and log message content.
4. Visualization: Anomalies are visualized over time to help identify patterns and periods of abnormal behavior.
5. Flexible and Scalable: The code is designed to handle large datasets, making it suitable for real-time log monitoring and analysis in microservice architectures.
